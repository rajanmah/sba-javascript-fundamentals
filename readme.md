# SBA JavaScript Fundamentals
With three given sets of data, I focused more on third set ie LearnerSubmissions as it contains most of the data that we need to bring them as the result. 

The first set of the data that CourseInfo was used to ensure the course_id are matched. I used try catch method to ensure the codes run well even if the couse id did not match in first two sets of the dats.

I used both Array and Object destructuring to get in to nested elements and their keys and values. For that I used if/else statements to maintain the control flow, used different Loops such as For Loop, For ... of Loop, and Array destructing functions of .map(), .forEach()


I tried to remove an object with the due_at "3156-11-15", I was not able to figure out how to. I should not include that data. but I included that in the total possible points too.
